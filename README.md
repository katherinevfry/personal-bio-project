# Personal Bio Project

## About this Project
I wanted this project to showcase not only my skill as a developer, but also my personal style! This comes across in the color scheme I chose. Green has always been my favorite color, and I wanted a creamy white to contrast that for accessability purposes. The collage element adds flair, and the slideshow helps condense a large about of text to keep the page clean. The page also displays the technologies I've learned, an area that displays some of the projects I'm most proud of, as well as ways to contact me and where to find me on the internet.
